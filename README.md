    Simulation of Information Spread in Social Networks
Project Introduction: This project is a simulation example designed to understand social network analysis and information spread. The project focuses on analyzing the structure of a social network, identifying the most influential individuals, and simulating the spread of influence step by step. The Erdos-Renyi model is used to generate the social network structure, and the PageRank algorithm is applied to evaluate node influence.

Project Results: 1)This project successfully models social network structures and analyzes influence among individuals. 2)The PageRank algorithm is effectively applied to identify the most influential individual in the network. 3)The information spread simulation clearly visualizes how influence propagates among individuals.
